                    <p>A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. This is a happy place, little
                        squirrels
                        live here and play. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to
                        look
                        to
                        see it. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. The shadows are just like the
                        highlights,
                        but we're going in the opposite direction. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.</p>

                    <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. I sincerely wish for you every possible
                        joy
                        life could bring. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. I guess that would
                        be
                        considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>

                    <p>In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Learn when to stop. Everything is happy if you
                        choose
                        to make it that way. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you
                        paint.
                        You can get away with a lot. Zip. That easy.</p>
